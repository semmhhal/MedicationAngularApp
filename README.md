 Medication Reviews/Side-Effects application:

The application helps users to review and report medications side effects.

- Implemented a login-based system with JWT.
- Ability to Browse medications and reading reviews is open to guests, but adding, updating, and deleting functionality is restricted to logged-in users.
- State properties in all components and services declared as a `signal`.
- Implement proper lazy-loading techniques for the user-protected components.
- Projects used Angular Material and have proper UI that complies with the web standards. Other UI kits are not permitted.
- Used the latest Angular version features.
- used the `ReactiveFormsModule` when working with form elements (data-driven). The `FormsModule` (template-driven) should not be used.
